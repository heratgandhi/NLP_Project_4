When you're standing in a craptastic excuse for a shower buttnaked and cold with soap in your hair because the water from the shower head has gone from a weak spray to a dribble to nothing coming out at all; nothing in the world will ever convince you to stay here again
Sometimes you just can't find fault with a hotel; even if you tried
The hotel is excellently situated for visiting The Art Institute or Millennium Park
